# Coding Problems

Every other day, I wish to solve another coding problem and push it to this git repo. I will start out by doing a couple problems in most C-based languages, then branch out into some higher level languages (chosen randomly). 

## Problem Statements

### Problem 1 (Project Euler) (Coding Language: C) : 

    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
    The sum of these multiples  is 23.

    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Problem 1 Answer: 233168

### Problem 2 (Project Euler) (Coding Language: C) : 

	Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
	two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    							
    	1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

	By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 
	four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Problem 2 Answer: 4613732

### Restarted May 6th, 2020 with Daily Coding Problems, will attempt Computer Language Benchmark Game and Project Euler
