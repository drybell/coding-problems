# Coding Problems

Every other day, I wish to solve another coding problem and push it to this git repo. I will start out by doing a couple problems in most C-based languages, then branch out into some higher level languages (chosen randomly). 

## Problem Statements

### Problem 1 (Project Euler) (Coding Language: C) : 

    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples  is 23. <br/>

    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
